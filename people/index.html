                Kathryn Church studied Psychology at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan (Masters 1983) and Sociology at OISE/University of Toronto (PhD 1993) during radical periods in the history of these departments. But it was psychiatric survivors who truly politicized her as she encountered them, their stories, and their activism while she was employed as an organizer in the mid-80s. These relationships propelled her into a decade of post-doctoral engagement as a “freelance” researcher working for and with psychiatric survivor organizations. Then, in 2002 she was drawn into Toronto Metropolitan University by the challenge of building a research program for the School of Disability Studies that would resonate with issues and debates in this emergent field.

            Dr. Peter Coppin, Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Design, is a
            designer, visual artist, and cognitive scientist. His work seeks to
            improve information access through a better understanding of how
            individuals make use of their diverse perceptual-motor capabilities to
            interact with interfaces and other designed artifacts (such as diagrams in
            problem solving or sonic interfaces to financial charts and graphs).
            </p>
            <p>
            Dr. Coppin's work is informed by his career journey, which cuts across
            engineering, design, and the visual arts. Dr. Coppin has authored numerous
            articles that focus on the perceptual-cognitive aspects of information
            interfaces with applications in diverse areas such as diagrammatic
            reasoning, research on dyslexia, learning technology, telescience,
            human-robot interaction, and data analytics. His work with government
            agencies and industry has included numerous projects related to the
            visualization of complex Earth and planetary datasets for NASA. Recent
            work tackles the challenge of accessible data analytics: Interfaces that
            enable low vision or blind individuals to access charts and graphs without
            visual perception.
            </p>
            <p>
            Dr. Coppin's work has been funded by multiple NASA programs, the US
            National Science Foundation, the Heinz Endowments, the R.K. Mellon
            Foundation, the Buhl Foundation, the Laurel Foundation, the Center for
            Innovation in Data-Driven Design, the Ontario Ministry of Training and
            Colleges, MITACS, and NCE GRAND. Dr. Coppin's work in electronic media
            art-design has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including
            Prix Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria), the SIGGRAPH Touchware Exhibition

So far this has lead him to develop an epistemological model of Human-Computer-Human Interaction that served as the framework for the development of COLE (Collaborative Online Learning environment), a prototype designed to study student online preferences and interactions.  These and other projects in the EILab’s can offer the possibilities of examining how learners and their instructors interact not only with each other but with any other resources in real time and with a multitude of data collection systems.

                Catherine Frazee is a writer, an educator and an activist.  These three identities come together for her at TMU, where she happily indulges her activist inclinations and curiosities about disability rights, disability arts and the place of disabled people in moral and political culture.  Drawing from her own experience of disablement as point of entry, she seeks to write and teach pathways into ethical and cultural dialogues about citizenship and personhood. Her present work is informed by many years of involvement in the equality struggles of disadvantaged and marginalized groups, most notably during a term as Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission from 1989 to 1992.

                Marlene Scardamalia holds the Presidents' Chair in Education and Knowledge Technologies at OISE/University of Toronto and directs IKIT, the Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology—a worldwide network of innovators working to advance the frontiers of knowledge building in various sectors. "Knowledge building," a term now widely used in education and knowledge management, originated with the CSILE/Knowledge Building project. Marlene led the team that created CSILE (Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments), which was the first networked knowledge building environment for education. The second generation version of this technology, <a href="https://www.knowledgeforum.com/">Knowledge Forum®</a>, is in use in countries worldwide, in education, health, business, and professional organizations. Knowledge building theories, models, practices and technologies have been developed in partnership with Carl Bereiter and team members.

                Jim Slotta is an associate professor of education in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at The University of Toronto, where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Education and Technology.  In 2006, he established the <a href="https://navigator.innovation.ca/en/facility/university-toronto/encore-lab">ENCORE lab</a>, a talented team of students, designers and developers who investigate collaborative inquiry learning in formal (K-12) and informal (home, field and museum) settings. In collaboration with researchers from Oslo, Chicago and Berkeley, Slotta and his team have developed the Scalable Architecture for Interactive Learning (SAIL), as well as a framework for smart classroom research called SAIL Smart Space.  Recent funded projects have examined the use of embedded phenomena in elementary classrooms, distributed and ubiquitous learning in high school physics, and an immersive rainforest simulation for high school biology.  Together, these projects have advanced a theoretical model known as Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI).  Professor Slotta and his team have published their work widely, with more than 50 papers presented at major conferences in the past three years.  Taken together, this work examines how students can become a knowledge community, supported by technology, to enable inclusive participation and promote the growth of ideas.

                Tanya Titchkosky pursues research and teaching in Disability Studies (DS). She does this work from her perspective as dyslexic and with an interpretive sociological approach informed by phenomenology; hermeneutics; critical disability, race, and queer theory. Along with being a full member of School of Graduate Studies (SGS), and part of the Women and Gender Studies Institute, U of T, she is also an Honorary Research Associate at the University of New Brunswick.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of her work in disability studies aims to explore the social meaning of embodiment as it is made manifest between people situated in world orders not of our own choosing.  Disability studies is then a place of critical inquiry where the meaning of our intersecting lives as bodies, minds, senses, emotions within complex webs of power and interpretations of normalcy can be explored and understood in new ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through both teaching and research, Tanya aims to examine how everyday life and social theory exclude and include disability within the politically charged interpretive milieu of social differences and desires, conflicts and commitments. As Principal Investigator of a standard SSHRC research grant, “The Cultural Production of Disability as an Excludable Type in University Life,” with co-investigator Dr. Rod Michalko, she is examining the ways in which educational contexts continue to include disability as an excludable type and how this relation is represented by images, texts, policy and programs that aim to fix, control, contain or manage disability within educational contexts.
